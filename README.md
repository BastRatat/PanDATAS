# PanDATAS

Daniel Biskupski, Michael Odartei Mills and I attended the Data Analytics bootcamp held by Le Wagon Chengdu in November 2019. 

Following the 5 weekly classes, we decided to meet up in order to deploy our first Flask app dedicated to our portfolio. We'll conduct data scraping using the BeautifulSoup framework and API and analyze our inputs.

This repo aims at keeping tracks of our progress.
