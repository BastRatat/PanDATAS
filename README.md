# portfolio

Daniel Biskupski and I both attended the Data Analytics bootcamp held by Le Wagon Chengdu in November 2019. 

Following the 5 weeks weekly classes, we decided to meet up in order to deploy our first Flask app dedicated to our portfolio.

This repo aims at keeping tracks of our progresses.
